          <p>Greetings! I'm Ot√°vio (Tav for some), a developer currently based in Ireland.</p>
          <p>
            I'm a problem solver and self-motivated Web Developer skilled in <span className="font-semibold text-lightsaberlight">building full Web Applications</span>, that means I can work on both
            back and frontend.
          </p>
          <p>
            I've changed career paths 3 years ago from a busy Dental Surgeon and Orthodontist in Brazil to an avid coder and programming enthusiast.
            I started learning code as a personal challenge. Well, this hobby, became a passion (as in I couldn't do anything else with my free time
            other than code), so I decided to start a more structured course in Web Development with <span className="font-semibold text-lightsaberlight">JavaScript</span>, <span className="font-semibold text-lightsaberlight">Node.JS</span>, <span className="font-semibold text-lightsaberlight">HTML</span> and <span className="font-semibold text-lightsaberlight">CSS</span>.
          </p>
          <p>
            A year later I decided to quit my job in Brazil and moved to Ireland to sharpen my English skills and also to be able
            to dedicate myself fully to coding and pursue a career in it. I'm 31 now and it has been a beautiful journey so far. Since I moved here
            I was able to reach C2 (proficient) level in English and secured a job as a <span className="font-semibold text-lightsaberlight">Full Stack Web Developer</span> for a Digital Marketing agency.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now I am capable of creating web apps and websites using not only JavaScript, but also <span className="font-semibold text-lightsaberlight">TypeScript</span>, <span className="font-semibold text-lightsaberlight">C#</span>, <span className="font-semibold text-lightsaberlight">React</span> and <span className="font-semibold text-lightsaberlight">Angular</span> among other
            technologies listed below. This portfolio itself was made from scratch using <span className="font-semibold text-lightsaberlight">React and Tailwind</span>, which is a highly customizable utility-first
            CSS framework.
